Prompt templates\\ncan include variables for few shot examples, outside context, or any other external data that is needed in your prompt.\\n\\nPrompts in LangSmith\\u200b\\nYou can store and version prompts templates in LangSmith.\\nThere are few key aspects of a prompt template to understand.\\nChat vs Completion\\u200b\\nThere are two different types of prompts: chat style prompts and completion style prompts.\\nChat style prompts are a list of messages. This is the prompting style supported by most model APIs these days, and so this should generally be preferred.\\nCompletion style prompts are just a string. This is an older style of prompting, and so mostly exists for legacy reasons.\\nF-string vs mustache\\u200b\\nYou can format your prompt with input variables using either f-string or mustache format. Here is an example prompt\\nwith f-string format:\\nHello, {name}!\\nAnd here is one with mustache:\\nHello, {{name}}!\\nMustache formatMustache format gives your more flexbility around conditional variables, loops, and nested keys.\\nRead the documentation\\nTools\\u200b\\nTools are interfaces the LLM can use to interact with the outside world. Tools consist of a name, description,\\nand JSON schema of arguments used to call the tool.\\nStructured Output\\u200b\\nStructured output is a feature of most state of the art LLMs, wherein instead of producing raw text as output they\\nstick to a specified schema. This may or may not use Tools under the hood.\\nStructured Output vs ToolsStructured outputs are similar to tools, but different in a few key ways. With tools, the LLM choose which tool to call (or may choose not to call any); with structured output, the LLM always responds in this format. With tools, the LLM may select multiple tools; with structured output, only one response is generate.\\nModel\\u200b\\nOptionally, you can store a model configuration alongside a prompt template. This includes the name of the model and any other parameters (temperature, etc).\\nPrompt Versioning\\u200b\\nVerisioning is a key part of iterating and collaborating on your different prompts.\\nCommits\\u200b\\nEvery saved update to a prompt creates a new commit. You can view previous commits, making it easy to review earlier prompt versions or revert to a previous state if needed. In the SDK, you can access a specific commit of a prompt by specifying the commit hash along with the prompt name (e.g. prompt_name:commit_hash).\\nIn the UI, you can compare a commit with its previous version by toggling the \"diff\" button in the top-right corner of the Commits tab.\\n\\nTags\\u200b\\nYou may want to tag prompt commits with a human-readable tag so that you can refer to it even as new commits are added. Common use cases include tagging a prompt with dev or prod tags. This allows you to track which versions of prompts are used where.\\nPrompt Playground\\u200b\\nThe prompt playground makes the process of iterating and testing your prompts seamless. You can enter the playground from the sidebar or directly from a saved prompt.\\nIn the playground you can:\\n\\nChange the model being used\\nChange prompt template being used\\nChange the output schema\\nChange the tools available\\nEnter the input variables to run through the prompt template\\nRun the prompt through the model\\nObserve the outputs\\n\\nTesting multiple prompts\\u200b\\nYou can add more prompts to your playground to easily compare outputs and decide which version is better:\\n\\nTesting over a dataset\\u200b\\nTo test over a dataset, you simply select the dataset from the top right and press Start.
